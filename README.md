## Introduction

### A note to the readers
> Our team sincerely prays for the sad demise of all the people who have lost their life in this pandemic.
> We also sincerely thank all the heroes who have kept their life on line to suppress the spread of the pandemic.
> We, students, wanted to build technologies that try to reduce human interactions as much as possible to help prevent the spread of the COVID.

Mask has become mandatory not just for the COVID pandemic, but also in routine life because of the increasing spread of diseases through air contamination. It is best advised for all the people to wear masks whenever they interact with someone. Hence this mask detection system.
